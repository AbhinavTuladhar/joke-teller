# joke-teller

A silly little app made for practising VueJS which uses [a JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) to fetch some jokes.

Options are available to choose various categories, and to blacklist some sensitive topics.

It also makes use of the TTS API of web browsers to speak the fetched joke. From testing, it is recommended to use Microsoft Edge as it offers 100+ voices as opposed to the measly 6-7 in Brave and Firefox (developer edition), which aren't even of good quality!
